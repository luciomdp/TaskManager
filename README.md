# TaskManager

TaskManager is a ticket tracking system developed as part of the Software Engineering course. The product emerged from a structured process of analysis and design, formalized in the [Software Requirements Specification (SRS)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ox3UCvo1gpB1wuGbCFhSyVnJDgYI6cJGv815iGRgD5A/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.xdqweopisnsu), carried out during the course.

## About

TaskManager is designed for the IT department of a company, allowing employees to report IT-related issues and request technical assistance. The main goal is to streamline the management of incoming requests and ensure they are properly assigned and resolved.

The system supports a role-based access structure, recognizing the hierarchy within the department. Different functionalities and permissions are available depending on the user's role—specialists, team leaders, and the department head—all contributing to efficient request handling and resource allocation.
